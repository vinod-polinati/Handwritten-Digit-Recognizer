# Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer

This is a code example that demonstrates how to train a simple neural network using TensorFlow and the MNIST dataset for image classification. The model architecture consists of three dense layers, and the code includes data preprocessing steps such as loading the dataset, reshaping the input images, and standardizing the pixel values.

## Prerequisites

To run this code, you'll need the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy

## Install the packages

--> TensorFlow : 

       pip install tensorflow

--> Import Keras using this which provides the Keras API within TensorFlow

       tensorflow.keras

--> Numpy : 
        
       pip install numpy
        
Verify installation :
                   
                   import numpy as np
                   print(np.__version__)
